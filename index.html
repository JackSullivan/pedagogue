<p>A place to organize resources and reflections on teaching and learning.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">When my nine-month old</span>  child plays with a toy, she can be equally entertained by the ‘toy part’ and
the tags, screw holes, and seams. She interacts with the world directly, she is full of beginner’s mind<label for="beginners-mind" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="beginners-mind" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><em>in the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s mind there are few</em> -
Shunryū Suzuki, <em>“Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind”</em> </span>.</p>

<p>When something grabs her interest, she looks at it deeply. She turns things around, bangs them against one another, puts
them in her mouth, each new thing is tirelessly subjected to all of the interaction modalities she has to hand, and new
ones are constantly being tested. I often have to stop myself from distracting her from an object she is attending to in
favor of whatever I have in mind for her to do. She has no dearth of focus.</p>

<p>She is dauntless in the face of setbacks, and setbacks are nearly incessant for a baby. At the moment, there is nothing
she wants more keenly than to be able to walk, which entails a good number of hard falls, even with the ready hands of
attendant parents close by. When she falls, she will sometimes cry for a moment or two, want a sip of her bottle, but
soon afterwards is eager to start trying again. She does not tire of failure, nor does it demoralize her.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">She already has the habits</span>  that are necessary for success in any field. They did not arrive in her by
education, but they can certainly be suppressed by it. My purpose with this work is to ensure that that does not happen.</p>
